# Template - Svelte (App)

A personal template I use to start a fresh Svelte app. It includes the following things that I find myself adding/updating in every new project:
-   Typescript
-   TailwindCSS
-   PostCSS
-   ESLint Flat Config (with [@huntabyte/eslint-config](https://github.com/huntabyte/eslint-config))
-   Prettier

This template will evolve over time as I find things to add/remove, but it's a good starting point with some sensible defaults.
